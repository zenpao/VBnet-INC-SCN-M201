SIDE NOTE:
Only run within the root folder e.g (C:\ , D:\, etc.).
Do not place within root folder sub directories which asks special permissions e.g (Program Files, Program Files(x86), etc.).
The solution was made with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and available in VS 2012. The program used Visual Basic.NET with primary interop assembly. The application can be run with its .EXE shortcut, hence, if lost, navigate to the SCN-M201 folder\bin\Debug\SCN-M201.exe .
